Questions:
What parts do we need to fix? 
Who will handle what parts? 


Decisions:
Read and understand the lib code. 
Most of the lib files are broken, they need to be fixed (protocol_*.c). 
Let's try to fix all the protocol_*.c today.  


Todo:
All - Finish reading and understanding the code in the lib.  
Gurwinder - protocol_client.c

Gurwinder & Alejandro - protocol_session.c

Questions:
What parts are fixed?
What issues did you have?
Need to fix the following from protocol_server.c :
      // FIXME: add ack message here to ensure that game is updated 
      // correctly everywhere... at the risk of making server dependent
      // on client behaviour  (use time out to limit impact... drop
      // clients that misbehave but be carefull of introducing deadlocks
How are we handling the game?


Decisions:
Fix protocol_server.c
Fix protocol_session.c
Understand the game logic and work on it. 
Look up and understand on how to add in tic tac toe. 


Todo:
Alejandro - protocol_server.c
Gurwinder - Add in basic tic tac toe game code
Matthew -
